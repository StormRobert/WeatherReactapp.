# React Weather App
The React Weather App is a simple web application that allows users to check the weather for various cities and manage their favorite cities. It is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Features
Current Weather: The app displays the current weather information for a city, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

Favorite Cities: Users can add and manage their favorite cities, and the app will remember them across sessions using local storage.

Card-Style Presentation: Each favorite city is presented as a separate card, making it easy to view and manage multiple cities.

Toggle Weather Display: The "Detail" button in the favorite cities component acts as a toggle button. Clicking it fetches and displays weather information if it's not already displayed or hides the weather information if it's already displayed.

Responsive Design: The app is designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.


### How to Use
Enter a city name in the search bar and click the search button to check the current weather for that city.

Use the "Add" button in the Favorite Cities section to add your favorite cities.

Manage your favorite cities by using the "Remove" button to delete a city or the "Details" button to toggle the weather display.
